# Datathon 2024-Analytical-Aces
A collaborative repository by Team 10: Analytical Aces, dedicated to analyzing and deriving insights from greenhouse gas emissions data across various industries. Our goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and potential strategies for reducing environmental impact, leveraging data science and analytics to contribute to sustainable solutions.

## Problem Statement

In the face of accelerating climate change, our team is tasked with analyzing industry-specific greenhouse gas emissions data. The challenge is to delve into datasets provided, ask critical questions, and apply data science methodologies to uncover insights. The end goal is not only to discern patterns and identify industry-specific emission trends but also to propose actionable strategies that could mitigate the environmental impact. This analytical endeavor aims to contribute meaningfully to the dialogue on sustainable practices.
