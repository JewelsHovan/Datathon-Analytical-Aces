# Datathon 2024-Analytical-Aces
A collaborative repository by Team 10: Analytical Aces, dedicated to analyzing and deriving insights from greenhouse gas emissions data across various industries. Our goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and potential strategies for reducing environmental impact, leveraging data science and analytics to contribute to sustainable solutions.

## Problem Statement

In the face of accelerating climate change, our team is focused on analyzing greenhouse gas emissions data with the intent to propose strategies for universities to significantly reduce their carbon footprint.  We see opportunities in identifying major sources of emissions and proposing solutions within areas like waste management, energy use, and transportation.

## Proposed Solution

To support decision-making for universities, we're developing a tool/dashboard to empower key stakeholders. This tool will:

* Visualize a  university's current carbon footprint.
* Highlight emissions reduction potential based on actionable changes.
* Provide an ESG-inspired rating to emphasize environmental responsibility, potentially improving investor appeal.
